label('Given the highly coercive consequences of having negative information reported to or by CRAs on consumer credit reports, I think it is reasonable that a debt not be deemed "verified" or "substantiated" unless and until there\'s a final non-appealable order, but only in circumstances where the consumer has timely disputed the existence or the amount of the debt.', a).
